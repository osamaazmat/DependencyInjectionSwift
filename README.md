# DependencyInjectionSwift
An easy and simple implementation of Dependency Injection in Swift

Dependency Injection is just a way of defining contracts that
can be used for any class that conforms to that contract.
 
It helps us in using multiple type of objects just because they
are conforming to the same protocol as a dependency.
